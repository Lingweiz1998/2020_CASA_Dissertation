# Dissertation Structure (Intro & Lit.)

### Introduction

1. Background: 
    1. Importance of Integrating Public Transport and Land Development (Cases, Document, etc.)
    2. Concept of TOD and some successful applications.
    3. Node-Place Model developed for TOD.
2. Conflict:
    1. Current NP model limited in regional scale research
    2. TOD has developed a system perspective
    3. Network analysis can fill in the gaps in the model, but the literature is very inadequate
3. Solutions(RQ):
    1. Assessing Transit-oriented-Development Using a Combination of Node-Place-Design Model and Network Analysis

### Literature Review

1. Literature on Node-Place Model
    1. General Information
    2. Current Research focus on 2 aspects
        1. Its application in Transit-Oriented Development
        2. Improvement of the model itself
    3. Current Limitation on NP model application
        1. Limited Regional Perspective
        2. TOD developed a Global Perspective
2. Literature on Network Analysis in Urban Research
    1. General Information
    2. Its characteristics (Why helpful for the previous limitation mentioned)
    3. Current Research (Lack in Literature)
